# Updated Schedule

| Date            | Goals | Status |
|---|---|---|
| April 15, 2017  | Set up a test harness to compare the performance of different best subset regression implementations with some example problems. | Complete |
| April 23, 2017  | Complete an initial CUDA implementation of the LSQ algorithm, and confirm its accuracy by using the example problems created in the first week. | C++ version complete |
| April 26, 2017  | Extend harness to use other state-of-the-art linear least squares solvers. |  |
| April 30, 2017  | Identify and experiment with different parts of the algorithm that can be parallelized. If time permits implement a hybrid CPU-GPU algorithm. |  |
| May 3, 2017     | Carry out experiments with each of the best subset regression implementations on well-conditioned problems. |  |
| May 7, 2017     | Carry out experiments with each of the best subset regression implementations on ill-conditioned problems. |  |
| May 10, 2017    | Resolve last minute issues and generate speedup graphs that will be used to show the effectiveness of the parallel GPU algorithm. |  |
